Abstract:

Which languages convey the most information in a given amount of space? This is
a question often asked of linguists, especially by engineers who often have some
information theoretic measure of "information" in mind, but rarely define
exactly how they would measure that information. The question is, in fact
remarkably hard to answer, and many linguists consider it unanswerable. But it
is a question that seems as if it ought to have an answer. If one had a database
of close translations between a set of typologically diverse languages, with
detailed marking of morphosyntactic and morphosemantic features, one could hope
to quantify the differences between how these different languages convey
information. Since no appropriate database exists we decided to construct
one. The purpose of this paper is to present our work on the database, along
with some preliminary results. We plan to release the dataset once complete.
